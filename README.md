## Project goals

The overall priority is to deliver a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) for the client, Bounce. Bounce requires a React frontend that communicates with a NodeJS backend running Express. 

The goal for Bounce is to create a frontend user interface that allows users to input any given country as a string and then have information about this country
rendered back to the user. 

The information about the country will be fetched via a NodeJS backend which will send requests to the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries). 

 ## Technologies:
- React
- NodeJS
- Express
